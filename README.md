### What I learned

How to use react routes and mange to navigate throw diffrent pages.

```js
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <RootLayout />,

    children: [
      { index: true, element: <Content /> },
      { path: ":countryId", element: <CountriesDetailsPage /> },
    ],
  },
]);
```

How to use redux to manage global states (Dark and Light mode).

```js
const modeSlice = createSlice({
  name: "mode",
  initialState: { colorMode: false },
  reducers: {
    toggle(state) {
      state.colorMode = !state.colorMode;
    },
  },
});
```

```js
const mode = useSelector((state) => state.mode.colorMode);
```

How sometimes you need to separate the fetch in a functions and returning the response, and assign the response data in another function to avoid stuckign in pending state.

```js
const fetchCountries = async (url) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error();
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message === "Failed to fetch")
      setErorrMessage("Failed to fetch data, try refreshing the page.");
    else setErorrMessage("Page not found");
    setErorr(true);
  }
};
```

```js
const setData = async (url) => {
    setLoading(true);
    const data = await fetchCountries(url);

    const loadedCountries = [];
    for (const key in data) {
      loadedCountries.push({
        id: key,
        flag: data[key].flags.png,
        altText: data[key].flags.alt,
        officalName:
        ...
```
